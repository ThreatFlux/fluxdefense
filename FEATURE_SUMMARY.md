# FluxDefense - Fully Implemented Features

## ‚úÖ All Features Now Using Real System Data

### 1. **Real-Time System Monitoring**
- **CPU Usage**: Uses `top` command to get actual CPU usage percentages
- **Memory Usage**: Uses `vm_stat` to get real memory statistics
  - Shows actual RAM usage in GB: `RAMüü¢56% (72.3GB)`
  - Displays total and used memory in tooltip
- **Network I/O**: 
  - Primary method: `nettop` for real-time network statistics
  - Fallback: `netstat -ib` for interface statistics
  - Shows actual bytes in/out per second
- **Disk I/O**: 
  - Primary method: `iostat` for disk read/write rates
  - Fallback: `df` for disk space monitoring
- **Process List**: Uses `ps aux` and `top` for real process enumeration
  - Shows actual running processes with CPU and memory usage
  - Displays process owner information

### 2. **Security Monitoring (Real Implementation)**
- **File System Monitoring**: 
  - Uses FSEvents API to monitor file system changes
  - Monitors critical directories:
    - `/Applications`
    - `/Library/LaunchDaemons`
    - `/Library/LaunchAgents`
    - User's Downloads folder
  - Detects file creation and modification in real-time
  
- **Process Monitoring**:
  - Checks for suspicious processes every 5 seconds
  - Detects potentially malicious tools:
    - netcat (`nc`)
    - nmap
    - tcpdump
    - Python scripts with socket connections
  
- **Whitelist Functionality**:
  - File hash calculation for verification
  - Path-based and hash-based whitelisting
  - Persistent storage of whitelist entries

### 3. **System Tray Display**
- Shows real-time metrics: `CPUüü¢16% RAMüü¢56% (72.3GB) NETüü¢‚óè DISKüü¢‚óè`
- Color-coded indicators:
  - üü¢ Green: Normal usage
  - üü° Yellow: Warning levels
  - üî¥ Red: Critical levels
- Updates every 3 seconds with real data

### 4. **Task Manager View**
- Displays all running processes from the system
- Real-time CPU and memory usage per process
- Sortable columns (Name, PID, CPU%, Memory)
- Search functionality to filter processes
- Shows process owner information
- Visual CPU usage bars

### 5. **Dashboard Features**
- Real-time threat detection count
- Today's security events counter
- Active monitoring status
- Quick actions for system scan and rule updates

### 6. **Security Logs**
- Real security events from file system monitoring
- Process start detection for suspicious applications
- Persistent event storage
- Filtering by severity level
- Event details with file paths and process information

### 7. **Settings Management**
- All settings are persisted to disk
- Real-time configuration changes
- Protection toggles actually affect monitoring behavior

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### System Monitoring
- **Memory**: Direct parsing of `vm_stat` output
- **CPU**: Parsing `top` command output for user + system CPU
- **Network**: Real interface statistics from system commands
- **Disk**: Actual I/O rates from `iostat`
- **Processes**: Complete process list from `ps aux`

### Security Monitoring
- **FSEvents**: Native macOS file system event monitoring
- **Process Detection**: Pattern matching on running processes
- **Hash Verification**: File content hashing for whitelist checks
- **Event Persistence**: JSON storage of security events

### Data Updates
- System metrics refresh every 3 seconds
- Process list updates every 5 seconds
- File system events are real-time
- Network and disk I/O tracked continuously

## üìä Performance Considerations
- Efficient use of system commands
- Caching to prevent excessive process spawning
- Rate limiting on security event creation
- Optimized UI updates using SwiftUI's @Published

## üîí Security Features
- No simulated data - all metrics are real
- Actual file system monitoring
- Real process detection
- Persistent whitelisting
- Event logging with timestamps

All features are now fully implemented with real system monitoring capabilities!
