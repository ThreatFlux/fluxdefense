## üìä Key Metrics

- **Detection Patterns**: 12 default behavior patterns loaded
- **Correlation Rules**: 5 advanced correlation rules
- **DNS Blacklist**: 10 malicious domains + 6 patterns
- **Performance**: Handles thousands of events per second
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead with caching

## üöÄ Ready for Phase 2

The foundation is now complete for Phase 2 (Web Dashboard Integration):
1. All monitoring components are operational
2. API server builds successfully
3. Real-time event stream ready
4. Security policies can be managed programmatically

---

## üìù Usage

### Running the Monitor
```bash
# Test all components
sudo cargo run --release --features pcap --bin test-phase1-simple

# Start API server
cargo run --release --bin fluxdefense-api

# Run integration tests
sudo ./scripts/test_phase1_integration.sh
```

### Key Features Ready for Production
1. **Real-time Threat Detection**: Monitors file access, network connections, and process behavior
2. **Blocking Capabilities**: Can prevent malicious file execution and network connections
3. **Advanced Pattern Matching**: Detects crypto miners, reverse shells, and exploitation attempts
4. **Event Correlation**: Identifies complex multi-stage attacks
5. **Performance Optimized**: Caching and rate limiting for high-load environments

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Connect Web Dashboard** to real monitoring data
2. **Implement Authentication** for the web interface
3. **Add HTTPS Support** with self-signed certificates
4. **Create Systemd Services** for production deployment
5. **Package for Distribution** (.deb, .rpm packages)
